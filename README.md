## Customization

### Adding New Events
Edit the `events` array in `App.tsx` to add or modify events:

```typescript
const events = [
  { 
    id: 5, 
    title: 'New Event', 
    date: 'Jan 15, 2025', 
    location: 'New Location', 
    image: 'üéâ' 
  },
  // ... more events
];
```

### Styling
All styles are defined in the `StyleSheet.create()` object at the bottom of `App.tsx`. You can modify colors, spacing, and layout by editing these styles.

### Adding New Screens
To add new screens:
1. Create a new render function (e.g., `renderNewScreen()`)
2. Add the screen to the `renderContent()` switch statement
3. Add navigation buttons to the bottom navigation

## Development Tips

- Use Expo Go for rapid development and testing
- The app automatically reloads when you save changes
- Use the React Native Debugger for advanced debugging
- Test on both Android and iOS devices for cross-platform compatibility

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements for future versions:
- Backend integration for real event data
